# TheCodeAttic.Learning.SitecoreHeadless

Repository documenting my learning of Sitecore Headless.

Each branch will correspond to a specific tutorial article, while **main** will always contains the fullest completed site. This should allow everyone to learn and reference in smaller chunks verses only having a single completed site to look at. 

I have designed these learnings to some what tie into building a brochure style site for *Rainfly Tours*, a business segment for my much beloved fictitious outdoor conglomerate Rainfly Adventures.
